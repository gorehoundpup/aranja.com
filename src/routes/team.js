              Aranja is a small web studio based and raised in Iceland. Our goal, to improve the web, is only achieved with a passionate team that is motivated and happy. We believe that the community is what makes the web what it is and we intend to support that.

              Instead of being a group of coworkers that only work together, we are friends that just happen to also work together. Frequently, we meetup after work to see the latest Marvel movie, hack on a side-project or just to enjoy a dinner with our families.
